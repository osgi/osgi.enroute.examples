# OSGi enRoute Examples

This is a repository that illustrates the [OSGi enRoute Service Catalog][enroute.services] with example application. Each project in this repository is a stand-alone OSGi enRoute application that exercises _the user of_ a particular service. In general, you can start the debug.bndrun in each project in debug and go to http://localhost:8080/<project-name>. Each project has a readme.md that will give you more details of what the application demonstrates. The applications themselves are also self documenting (at least that is the intent).
